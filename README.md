# E-commerce Demo

This is a sample application that demonstrates an E-commerce website using the MEAN stack. The application loads 
products a MongoDB database and displays them. Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can 
click on any product to get more information including pricing, reviews and rating. Users can select items and 
add them to their shopping cart. The application will hopefully load quickly and allow for fast item selction and check-out.f

## Import Data
I have included a data folder in this repo. Inside that folder will be 2 folders called cart and item. These 2 folders contain a mongodump of the 2 collections that I use in this ecommerce demo. You can use the [import-data.sh](data/import-data.sh) script to import these 2 dumps to an ecommerce database, then you will have the same content that I have for this demo.

## Live Demonstration
